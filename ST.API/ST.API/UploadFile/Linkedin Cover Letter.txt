Dear HR Manager, 

Hope you are doing good!

I was browsing through job openings in LinkedIn and I happen to see a job opportunity with Rokt. With a Bachelor’s Degree in science, 9+ years of hands-on experience in creating and implementing software applications, and the ability to troubleshoot and solve problems in a timely and accurate manner, I confidently express my interest in your job posting for an experienced Full Stack Engineer. I have been involved in numerous software releases and understand the importance of time management and open communication. While it may be easy to focus on the technical side of work, I’ve found that being able to express concerns, roadblocks, and alternative solutions to colleagues of varying technical backgrounds has been invaluable in my professional development. 

Over the course of my career as a software engineer I have:
	1. Managed teams and supported clients from non technical backgrounds
	2. Worked on different technologies like Angular, Web API, ASP .Net, MVC, C#,  		SSIS,      Crystal Reports, Oracle Pl\SQL, SQL Server etc...
	3. Optimized applications by implementing various client side frameworks
	4. 6 month onsite experience in USA.
I am currently in India and I require visa sponsorship to work in Australia.For a greater illustration of my background and qualifications, please review my enclosed resume. I am eager to speak with you about this opportunity and thoroughly appreciate your consideration.
